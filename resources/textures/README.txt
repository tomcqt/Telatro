Hi, from the dev of Talatro!

These textures took fffooorrreeevvveeerrr
I had to manually resize every texture to it's closest power of 2 in order to have WebGL shaders actually work because I didn't feel like making a script to do so
If you want to modify these textures, please have at it.
This took so long
I hate textures

Oh and btw

Thx! <3 tomcat
